# Haskell installation guide 2018 for Windows 7

1) Remove all previous Haskell installations. No need to clean registry, just use tools like Revo Uninstaller and manually delete folders C:\Users\{Name}\AppData\Roaming\Cabal and C:\Users\{Name}\AppData\Roaming\Ghc afterwards.

2) Install Git for Windows, https://git-scm.com/download/win. Check "Additional items on the Desktop" during installation, we will be using Git Bash a lot. Leave the rest as it is.
